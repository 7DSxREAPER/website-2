1. **Improvements in our automated component generator** 

RoboComp’s components are automatically generated using a tool named robocompdsl which takes as input a text file written in a domain-specific language named (Component Description Specific Language). These files describe several characteristics of the components such as the network connections to other components, the programming language in which it is going to be written (currently C++ and Python languages are supported), the kind of user interface it will have (if any) and other options such as if the component will make use of third-party libraries. Given a CDSL file and a path, robocompdsl generates a source code tree ready to be compiled for the component described in the file. In this source code tree there are files which the user will not need to modify (these are called generic files) and files in which the user is supposed to type the code (specific files). Once a component has been generated, only generic files are overwritten upon re-generation, new specific files are created with an additional ‘.new’ extension. This tool allows users to create components very quickly, avoid bad design decisions derived from the extra work creating new components would entail without the tool.

Despite robocompdsl benefits, there are updates to make and features to introduce. This is the goal of this GSoC’16 proposal, to have a student to help us improve the tool. In particular, we propose the following:

- Qt5 support.
- ROS support (currently underway).
- Allowing to automatically generate code to display 3D robotic models.
- Improve the Python template.

Supporting Qt5 would be interesting because the new version of the library is now quite mature, has new features and someday Qt4 will be outdated.

ROS support is interesting because there is a number of robot hardware pieces that provide ROS components to interface with the hardware and it is used in robotic competitions to communicate with the electronic referee. Supporting ROS within our framework will allow users to use ROS and RoboComp components seamlessly.

Displaying 3-dimensional information is a really common task in robotics. It is used to show how the robots perceive the world, how the kinematic tree of the robots is configured (i.e., in which position they have their limbs), the position of the robots in the maps, or to display  input 3D point clouds. Since this task is so important and common we would also like to enable robocompdsl to generate the corresponding code if the user is going to need to display 3D information.

As previously mentioned, robocompdsl can generate code for different programming languages. Currently it supports C++ and Python. There are features that are included in the C++ version that are missing in the Python template.

2. **Ease robocomp deployment**

The idea is through several tasks ease the deployment of the Robocomp framework within a system. 

- First a polish of the cmake structure within robocomp should be made, so basics requirements for installation are reduced to a minimum. On the same page this should ease the task for new developers to add new libraries, classes, tools or modules to the framework. 
- A fully functional docker container for robocomp should be developed so instant deployment can be performed through the docker tool.
- Along with the main repository, developers use their own components repositories, usually having several of them within the same installation of robocomp. This becomes a source of mistakes as it leads to forgotten pulls or pushs to the git repo. Therefore a system that will help updating the whole robocomp infrastructure should be developed to avoid this problems.
