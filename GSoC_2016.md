1. **Improvements in our automated component generator**

RoboComp’s components are automatically generated using a tool named robocompdsl which takes as input a text file written in a domain-specific language named (Component Description Specific Language). These files describe several characteristics of the components such as the network connections to other components, the programming language in which it is going to be written (currently C++ and Python languages are supported), the kind of user interface it will have (if any) and other options such as if the component will make use of third-party libraries. Given a CDSL file and a path, robocompdsl generates a source code tree ready to be compiled for the component described in the file. In this source code tree there are files which the user will not need to modify (these are called generic files) and files in which the user is supposed to type the code (specific files). Once a component has been generated, only generic files are overwritten upon re-generation, new specific files are created with an additional ‘.new’ extension. This tool allows users to create components very quickly, avoid bad design decisions derived from the extra work creating new components would entail without the tool.

Despite robocompdsl benefits, there are updates to make and features to introduce. This is the goal of this GSoC’16 proposal, to have a student to help us improve the tool. In particular, we propose the following:

- Qt5 support.
- ROS support (currently underway).
- Allowing to automatically generate code to display 3D robotic models.
- Improve the Python template.

Supporting Qt5 would be interesting because the new version of the library is now quite mature, has new features and someday Qt4 will be outdated.

ROS support is interesting because there is a number of robot hardware pieces that provide ROS components to interface with the hardware and it is used in robotic competitions to communicate with the electronic referee. Supporting ROS within our framework will allow users to use ROS and RoboComp components seamlessly.

Displaying 3-dimensional information is a really common task in robotics. It is used to show how the robots perceive the world, how the kinematic tree of the robots is configured (i.e., in which position they have their limbs), the position of the robots in the maps, or to display  input 3D point clouds. Since this task is so important and common we would also like to enable robocompdsl to generate the corresponding code if the user is going to need to display 3D information.

As previously mentioned, robocompdsl can generate code for different programming languages. Currently it supports C++ and Python. There are features that are included in the C++ version that are missing in the Python template.

2 **Ease robocomp deployment**

The idea is through several tasks ease the deployment of the Robocomp framework within a system. 

- First a polish of the cmake structure within robocomp should be made, so basics requirements for installation are reduced to a minimum. On the same page this should ease the task for new developers to add new libraries, classes, tools or modules to the framework. 
- A fully functional docker container for robocomp should be developed so instant deployment can be performed through the docker tool.
- Along with the main repository, developers use their own components repositories, usually having several of them within the same installation of robocomp. This becomes a source of mistakes as it leads to forgotten pulls or pushs to the git repo. Therefore a system that will help updating the whole robocomp infrastructure should be developed to avoid this problems.

3 ** Object detection for simulated environments **

We have several algorithms that are trained with information from real environments. Making this algorithms work in our simulation environment is not the straightforward task it should be. We would like to have a tool that takes as input several 3D objects and generates the infrastructure needed to train these algorithms. As an example provided to users different algorithms must be trained so their effectivity can be tested with the robocomp simulation environment. Development of some Neural Networks Structures might be required to improve the algorithms results.

4 ** Computer vision components and integration with openDetection **

Open Detection is a library developed by a student during GSoC 2015. The idea was to develop a library to ease the development of computer vision tasks such as object recognition. This library is now a stand alone project but in robocomp we would like to keep a link with it and have some examples integrated in our components structure. An automated integration of this library should be performed such as it becomes transparent for the robocomp user. Also several components should be developed making use of the main features of this library so the computer vision algorithms from Open Detection can be used through different components interfaces. 

Along with this some extra components will be required to be developed as an abstraction for the main features of other Computer Vision Libraries such as OpenCV and the Point Cloud Library.

5 ** Automate uploading of binary files for git-annex **

The process of uploading binary files to git-annex is currently a tedious task and it ends up with developers trying to avoid the use of this tool and looking for alternatives to store binary files. A new alternative needs to be developed ether having a specific tool for that automates the addition of new bin files to git-annex or switching to a new tool that takes care of the binary files. First a tedious research in current alternatives and or proper solutions to the git-annex problem should be discussed. After the community selects one among the proposed solutions this must be implemented by the student and all previous binaries should be ported to the new solution. 

The final solution should basically be a command that would take the binary as an input upload it to the storage server and add the link to git-annex or the selected technology in charge of the binary files tracking.

6 ** Model graph visualization enhancements **

Current Model graphs used in robocomp mainly for cognitive world modeling are not clear to understand, especially when they are big, which they usually are. Making these graphs easier to read and their information easier to access is a key task that will ease the task of debugging and understanding these graphs and in consequence a robot’s mind. Specific research and tests with roboticists should be performed in order to find a way of displaying this information that helps anyone understand the whole graph. Once specific key assets are detected they should be implemented one by one  and properly tested with some roboticists to ensure they are widely accepted as a proper enhancement. Several of these features should be developed until the graph becomes easily readable and can be easily managed through the graphical interface provided in robocomp.
