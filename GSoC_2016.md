**RoboComp’s DSL based code generator**

RoboComp’s components are automatically generated using a tool named robocompdsl which takes as input a text file written in a domain-specific language (DSL) named (Component Description Specific Language). These files describe several characteristics of the components such as the network connections to other components, the programming language in which it is going to be written (currently C++ and Python languages are supported), the kind of user interface it will have (if any) and other options such as if the component will make use of third-party libraries. Given a CDSL file and a path, robocompdsl generates a source code tree ready to be compiled for the component described in the file. In this source code tree there are files which the user will not need to modify (these are called generic files) and files in which the user is supposed to type the code (specific files). Once a component has been generated, only generic files are overwritten upon re-generation, new specific files are created with an additional ‘.new’ extension. This tool allows users to create components very quickly, avoids frequent errors and contributes to keep high quality coding standards.

Despite the undeniable benefits brought by robocompdsl, there are some important updates to make and new features to introduce. This is the goal of this GSoC’16 proposal, to have a student to help us improve the tool. In particular, we propose the following new features:

1.- **Qt5 and ROS support**

- Qt5 support. Currently only Qt4, both in C++ and Python, are supported. Supporting Qt5 would be interesting because the new version of the library is now quite mature, has new features and someday Qt4 will be outdated. Also, there is already support for Qt5 in Python through PyQt5. The work needed for this activity will deal with the necessary modifications in the DSL parsing and code generation.

- ROS support (currently underway). ROS support is a pressing issue mainly due to the high popularity of ROS and the possibility to access a number of robot hardware elements that provide ROS interfaces and other interesting packages provided by research groups and companies. Also, it is the usual way of talking to virtual referees in robotic competitions. Supporting ROS within our framework will allow users to use ROS and RoboComp components seamlessly.

Technologies involved:  C++, Python, Qt5, ROS

2. **Javascript support**

- NodeJS component code generation. An interesting diversion from current robotics technologies based on C++ and Python would be the use of Javascript as the language to code some highly concurrent components. Most components combine push-pull and RPC communication models to talk to other components in their graph of processes. Additionally, several more threads are normally used to handle the component’s internal workings. In this activity, the code generator will be extended to include Javascript running in a server as a new target language for components. The main restriction here is that ZeroC releases a version of the Ice middleware running on Node, since the web browser version is already out.

3. ** Automatic code generation for State Machines**

- Currently, the code generator only generates code for the generic part of the component, including the communications middleware and the binary building machinery. In this activity we want to extend  robocompdsl to allow for the specification of a state machine, as the computing model driving the specific functionality of the component. The component definition language will now include instructions to define a set of states and transitions between them, so a functioning machine using Qt State Machine Framework is automatically instantiated when generated.

Technologies involved:  C++, Python, Qt

4 **Facilitating the deployment of RoboComp on different platforms**

Deployment of a complex framework on different, heterogeneous platforms is always a difficult problem. Also, horizontally scaling the deployment of components when more computational resources are needed is also a complicated issue. The idea of this activity is to ease the deployment of the Robocomp framework within several different platforms and to provide tools to decouple the logical graph of processes from the underlying hardware. In order to achieve that the thing needed to be done are: 

- First, a refactoring of the CMake structure within RoboComp is needed so basic requirements for installation are reduced to a minimum. On the same page, this activity should ease the task for new developers to add new libraries, classes, tools or modules to the framework. 
- To facilitate the deployment on different operating systems, a fully functional Docker container for RoboComp will be developed so instant deployment will be available on heterogeneous platforms through the docker tool.
- A semi-automatic procedure to update changes from the repository to the Docker container will be established.
- To study and analyze virtual infrastructure solutions, such as Open Stack, to provide a virtualized infrastructure that can integrate the physical cluster onboard the robot and external servers for less responsive, but highly computationally demanding,  tasks.

5 **Object detection for simulated environments**

We have several algorithms that are trained with information from real environments. Making this algorithms work in our simulation environment is not the straightforward task it should be. We would like to have a tool that takes as input several 3D objects and generates the infrastructure needed to train these algorithms. As an example provided to users different algorithms must be trained so their effectivity can be tested with the robocomp simulation environment. Development of some Neural Networks Structures might be required to improve the algorithms results.

6 **Computer vision components and integration with openDetection**

Open Detection is a library developed by a student during GSoC 2015. The idea was to develop a library to ease the development of computer vision tasks such as object recognition. This library is now a stand alone project but in robocomp we would like to keep a link with it and have some examples integrated in our components structure. An automated integration of this library should be performed such as it becomes transparent for the robocomp user. Also several components should be developed making use of the main features of this library so the computer vision algorithms from Open Detection can be used through different components interfaces. 

Along with this some extra components will be required to be developed as an abstraction for the main features of other Computer Vision Libraries such as OpenCV and the Point Cloud Library. 

*Technologies involved:  C++, OpenCV, Pointcloud Library, cmake*

7 **Automating the uploading of binary files for git-annex**

The process of uploading binary files to git-annex is currently a tedious task and it ends up with developers trying to avoid the use of this tool and looking for alternatives to store binary files. A new alternative needs to be developed ether having a specific tool for that automates the addition of new bin files to git-annex or switching to a new tool that takes care of the binary files. First a tedious research in current alternatives and or proper solutions to the git-annex problem should be discussed. After the community selects one among the proposed solutions this must be implemented by the student and all previous binaries should be ported to the new solution. 

The final solution should basically be a command that would take the binary as an input upload it to the storage server and add the link to git-annex or the selected technology in charge of the binary files tracking. 

*Technologies involved: git, git-annex, C++, cmake*

8 **3D visualization of internal structures in real time**

Current Model graphs used in RoboComp mainly for cognitive world modeling are not clear to understand, especially when they are big, which they usually are. Making these graphs easier to read and their information easier to access is a key task that will ease the task of debugging and understanding these graphs and in consequence a robot’s mind. Specific research and tests with roboticists should be performed in order to find a way of displaying this information that helps anyone understand the whole graph. Once specific key assets are detected they should be implemented one by one  and properly tested with some roboticists to ensure they are widely accepted as a proper enhancement. Several of these features should be developed until the graph becomes easily readable and can be easily managed through the graphical interface provided in robocomp.
