      <i><b>RoboComp</b> is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</i>

    <p><strong>Open Detection:</strong> Following the idea that it is better to have an independent library for Object Detection than contributing directly to Robocomp, I created the new library &#39;Open Detection&#39;. It is available now in the following links</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Github link: https://github.com/krips89/opendetection</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation link: http://krips89.github.io/opendetection_docs/index.html</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried to document/provide tutorial inside the library whenever possible. So instead of writing everything here in the blog I&#39;ll just post links to the tutorials/documentations.</p>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link: https://github.com/krips89/opendetection/blob/master/doc/tutorials/content/installation_instruction.rst</li>
</ul>

<h3>Library Design</h3>

<p>The basic idea was to have a library with common and simple interface giving access to varies detection methods available here. After some thinking I came up with the design explained in the following tutorial:</p>

<ul>
<li>https://github.com/krips89/opendetection/blob/master/doc/tutorials/content/basic_structures.rst</li>
</ul>

<p>The class diagrams providing a good reference is provided here:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://krips89.github.io/opendetection_docs/inherits.html</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>I did not document extensively till now as building an independent library from the scratch took a long time. The other very important reason is that the design is till little vulnerable to changes.
I would wait little bit more for the design to be more concrete before I start documenting extensively. </p>

<h2>Things finished</h2>

<p>Within this time frame I could finish the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Design of the library.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete CMake infrastructure for modular building of the library from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>2D feature based object detection (both Training and Detection phase) with demo.</p></li>
<li><p>Global feature based object detection (both training and detection phase) with demo.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto generated Documentation using Doxygen (http://krips89.github.io/opendetection_docs/index.html).</p></li>
<li><p>Sphinx based tutorial section to generate nice pages for tutorials and blogs like that of PCL.</p></li>
<li><p>Few other Utility classes which fits the needs and design for the library.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Milestones and things learnt:</h3>

<p>In the next blog I&#39;ll add the different sources I used to design and implement the above tasks and the things I learnt in this process.</p>

    <h3>rc<em>init</em>ws</h3>

<p>This will initialize a Robocomp workspace in the current/specified directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rc_init_ws [path]
</code></pre></div>
<h3>rcbuild</h3>

<p>When invoked form workspace without any arguments if not inside source path, it will build all the non-ignored components inside the workspace,  if inside any component source directory it will build only that component. But if a component is specified it will build it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"> rcbuild [-h] [-i | --doc | --installdoc] [component]
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>doc</code> will generate documentation, <code>installdoc</code> will install the docs to install path, <code>install</code> will build and install the components. currently you can only generate docs for one component at a time.</p>

<h3>rccomp</h3>

<p>This dosent have much functions as of now. <code>rccomp list</code> will list all the components.</p>

<h3>rced</h3>

<p>when invoked as component-name file-name. it will open the the file in the component. if multiple files with same name exists, it will give choices and will ask you to choose one. It uses the editor specified in $EDITOR by default, if not present it will use <code>vim</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rced [-h] component file
</code></pre></div>
<h3>rcrun</h3>

<p>Using rcrun you can start, stop or force stop any component from anywhere. You can also start a component in debug mode, given you have the required <em>config file</em> in the <em>etc</em> directory. If you have specified a config file then rcrun will use it to start the component. By default rcrun will use the <code>config</code> config file in <code>etc</code> directory, if not found it will search for <code>generic_config</code> if not found it will use any of config files present.If the debug flag is set, it will search for a config file that ends with <em>.debug</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rcrun [-h] [-s START |-st STOP | -fst FSTOP] [-d | -cf CFILE | -c CONFIG] [-is] [component]
</code></pre></div>
<h3>rccd</h3>

<p>Using this you can cd into the component directory given the component name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rccd component
</code></pre></div>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Built a website for robocomp using jekyll. </p>

<p><strong>Progress:</strong> Took the task of building a website for documenting the open source project <em>RoboComp</em> for the first 4 weeks of Google Summer of Code 2015. The website should be able to segregate the posts into categories, Make it easy for users to post content and most importantly have a proper flow among the posts so that a new users will find it easy to learn the framework.</p>

<p>Started building the website by using the <a href="https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll">dbyll theme</a>. Messed around with the code a bit and had the website up for robocomp. Website <a href="https://rajathkumar.github.io/robocomp">link</a>. After a few iterations the website was all good. While exploring on the same topic stumbled upon <a href="https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/">Type theme</a>. Which was a jekyll based them more clean and elegant than the first one. Ported the entire website to the type theme and currently have shifted the <a href="http://robocomp.github.io/website/">website</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/robocomp">robocomp organization on github</a>. Currently have tweaked the website based on the suggetsions recieved by the mentors.</p>

<p>Version-1 : https://github.com/robocomp/website/tree/version-1</p>

<p><strong>Future:</strong> Will implement automatic segregation of posts based on categories the user mention. Extend the features of the website and add analytics, comments for blog posts etc. Give the website its final iterations based on the suggestions recieved.</p>

        New build system and workspace model in Robocomp <p>#2</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>For managing these components we would need different utilities. So i started compiling a list of different utilities keeping a reference to other frameworks. Finally i have decide on my list</p>

<ul>
<li>rc<em>init</em>ws<br></li>
<li>rcbuild<br></li>
<li>rced<br></li>
<li>rccd<br></li>
<li>rcrun<br></li>
<li>rccomp<br></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the utilities see the <a href="http://robocomp.github.io/website/2015/06/26/nithin6.html">tutorial</a> on build utilities. All the utilities are implemented using python except <code>rccd</code> which is implemented as a shell function, As a subprocess cant affect its parents environment. So i was thinking, as anyway we will need to source a bash script, we could move the exporting of the environment variables also into that script. </p>

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>One useful feature that needs to be implemented is auto complete for the arguments. It would be a very useful feature as we don&#39;t need need to know the exact component name, etc. Also some work on the manifest.xml has to be done. It was planned to contain basic info on packages like name, maintainer, dependencies etc. I didn&#39;t do it right now because i was not really sure about the component dependencies, i will need to discuss about it a bit.</p>

        <i>GSoC,</i> 2015 ideas
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>1.- <strong>RoboComp tutorial, social management and documentation</strong>: RoboComp’ sources has been ported to GitHub and we are building a new documentation repository there. We are using GitHub markdown language (GFM) write new docs and turorials. We want to build a set of short tutorials that guide the new users along several interconnected topics, such as component oriented programming, robotics, computer vision, robotics software modules integrating heterogeneous sources, cognitive architectures and testing and validating, all from inside RoboComp. These new tutorials will be developed using RoboComp’s robotics simulator, RCIS, so interactive examples can be created and used in the explanations. This package also includes work on automated installation scripts using CMake. Generic knowledge of linux systems, website and wiki administration is needed. This is a key task for our project as it would bring more attention to it as it will open the development to new people interested in the field.</p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate programming and systems administration.</p>

<p>2.- <strong>Computer vision components and libraries management</strong>: RoboComp is being used to build a new cognitive architecture called RoboCog. Among the different modules already in progress, the object detection module is crucially important. We are pursuing an efficient 2D/3D vision pipeline that, working with the robot body control module, is able to localize, recognize, fit a pre-existing model and track a series of daily objects that the robot might encounter. Grasping would be one target of this pipeline, or even a means to complete recognition. There are currently many components implementing computer vision algorithms and intensive work done in pipeline construction. The key tasks on this idea would be to collaborate in the creation of high level tools to organize, document and test different pipelines for an specific task. These tools will be designed in collaboration with the mentors and tested in RoboComp’s RCIS simulator and real robots.</p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate computer vision knowledge, C++ programming, basic CMake knowledge</p>

<p>3.- <strong>RoboComp Building and deployment system design</strong>: Current CMake building system in RoboComp is limited only to the core libraries, the RCIS simulator and some additional tools. A very useful task would be to come up with a more complex CMake structure that could build the entire system, including all finished components, without breaking current dependencies. Also, a few scripts will have to be built to compile individual components, run tests, search and inspect the source tree efficiently, check dependencies and documentation requirements. This code needs also to take into account the dependencies between components that can be stored in xml-like files -i,e, manifestos- within the component itself.</p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate CMake knowledge, programming in C++, basic knowledge of shell scripting</p>

<p>4.- <strong>Deployment generator and run-time monitoring</strong>: When creating a specific robot architecture, many components have to be brought into a common deployment environment. Each component has its runtime configuration and network parameters that have to be declared in a common deployment file, from where the complete system can be brought to life. This task proposes the design of a domain specific language to facilitate the creation of shellscript deployment files that are syntactically and semantically correct. Once a net of RoboComp components is up and running, additional tools are needed to monitorize their execution through an existing default interface called CommonBehavior.This tool will use the DSL as input and will show a graphical representation of the running system. It will be written in Python and will extend important efforts already made in this direction.</p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate programming with Python and introductory knowledge of formal languages</p>
