Hello, 
in this post I will explain in summary form some technologies used in **RoboCompDSL.**

## Model Driven Engineering MDE

Model driven engineering (Model-driven engineering) is a generic methodology that is based on knowledge of a specific domain to allow creating generic models (meta-models) of a problem to solve. This allows for greater abstraction of the problem and its surroundings, making it easier to find an efficient and complete solution. In this way, you can create models that users unfamiliar with the problem environment, could work in the domain of interest or even facilitate communication between individuals of a team working in various specific domains within the same working environment.

It is very common to use domain-specific languages ​​(Domain-Specific Language) that can be defined as text, diagrams, etc. To deal with these models. Have tools that deal with these DSLs could detect errors in the use of language or provide a user interface to enable work with models a simpler, guided and robust way.
MDE use in oriented components can be an even intuitive programming practice because it would be very easy to specify a model for deployment and communications components or specification of the interfaces they use.

## Domain-specific languages

There are many possible solutions that can be given for the same problem, choose one or the other will always depend on the quality of the result and the cost to get it. The domain-specific languages ​​can reduce the cost of carrying out a project without affecting the result. A clear example would be given in many cases where we have component-oriented routine code that could be specified once and reused the rest of the time schedule. DSLs are widely used in many projects such as SQL or HTML5.
