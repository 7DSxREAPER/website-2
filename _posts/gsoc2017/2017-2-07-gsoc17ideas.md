## General information on applications

If you are interested in any of the ideas listed bellow or you think you can propose something interesting to improve RoboComp we encourage you to apply. It is important to get familiarized with the software first. You can go through the available tutorials and direct your questions to the mailing list or gitter chat (listed below, also see conctact section). Please read all the information posted in this page before applying. Make sure you are familiarized with the required skills for the idea. Several RoboComp tools and components are mentioned on the ideas, to keep this list short explanation on them is not included here. We encourage everyone to check the RoboComp documentation linked bellow to get some knowledge bout these tools. Mentors and backup mentors are listed right after the idea explanation. All mentors contact info is at the end of the page. 

**Where can I start and what to include on my application?**   
You are encoraged to go through these steps for a better understading and follow up of your application.

1. Download robocomp: [https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp)
2. Get familiarized with the framework: [https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/master/doc](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/master/doc)
3. Try to write down a small example of code that shows how you would start the development on the idea you choosed
4. Create a schedule with the milestones you plan to follow during the GSoC 2017 program
5. You can send the code example and the schedule along with your cv and other application materials to the main mentor of your idea, cc the backup mentor

## IDEAS LIST for GSoC 2017:

## 1. Javascript support

NodeJS component code generation. An interesting diversion from current robotics technologies based on C++ and Python would be the use of Javascript as the language to code some highly concurrent components. Most components combine push-pull and RPC communication models to talk to other components in their graph of processes. Additionally, several more threads are normally used to handle the component’s internal workings. In this activity, the current component code generator of RoboComp will be extended to include Javascript running in a server as a new target language for components. The main restriction here is that ZeroC releases a version of the Ice middleware running on Node, since the web browser version is already out.

Needed skills: Javascript, C++  
Mentor: Pablo Bustos  
Backup mentor: Luis Manso

## 2. Graphic deployment tool

Currently RoboComp has a components management tool that has actually been improved through several years. However an xml file should be provided with the configuration on the components network for this tool to work. This xml contains the information of the deployment of the network of components. Having this xml file created through the graphical tool would help enormously in the deployment of new setups for different projects. In this idea you will expand the current components management graphical tool to allow roboticists design their networks of components in an easy way.

Needed skills: Python, C++, QT  
Mentor: Ramon Cintas  
Backup mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez

## 3. Connect RoboComp to Gazebo

RoboComp currently has its own simulation tool RCIS (RoboComp Innermodel Simulator) however it does not incorporate physics simulation. Additionally, some robot models are already available under Gazebo, which is a more spread simulation environment than RCIS. Having gazebo as an option for simulations with RoboComp will help grow the possibilities that our framework can offer to users and developers. The idea is to connect RoboComp and Gazebo in a similar way ROS is connected to Gazebo. As a result, any simulation with RoboComp should be able to be deployed on both simulators (Gazebo or RCIS).

Needed skills: Gazebo, C++, Robotics simulation   
Mentors: Marco A. Gutiérrez  
Backup mentor: Pablo Bustos

## 4. Graphic editor for InnerModel worlds

InnerModel worlds are xml-based files. Most of the time writing down becomes a pain that nobody wants to go through. Even when InnerModel worlds are done, sometimes moving its elements becomes cumbersome. Sometimes it takes several tryouts until whatever you want to move ends up in the right place. Having a graphical tool for creating and editing these files would help enormously.

Needed skills: C++, OSG or some sort of graphics development knowledge, CMake   
Mentor: Luis Manso  
Backup mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez

## 5. Easing deployment, reduce dependencies, “dockering” robocomp

Docker is a good way to make sure software works independent of the configuration of the system it’s being run. Having demos of RoboComp enclosed into different docker containers can help with deployment in different machines as well as preserve the integrity of a certain demo when it comes the time to run it. 
You will also be responsible of writing down the robocomp-docker documentation and related tutorials. This project idea includes:

* First, a refactoring of the CMake structure within RoboComp is needed so basic requirements for installation are reduced to a minimum. On the same page, this activity should ease the task for new developers to add new libraries, classes, tools or modules to the framework.
* To facilitate the deployment on different operating systems, a fully functional Docker container for RoboComp will be developed so instant deployment will be available on heterogeneous platforms through the docker tool.
* A semi-automatic procedure to update changes from the repository to the Docker container will be established.

Needed skills: Docker, GNU/Linux, C++, CMake  
Mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez  
Backup mentor: Ramon Cintas

## 6. 3D visualization of internal structures in real time 

Current Model graphs used in RoboComp mainly for cognitive world modeling are not clear to understand, especially when they are big, which they usually are. Making these graphs easier to read and their information easier to access is a key task that will ease the task of debugging and understanding these graphs and in consequence a robot’s mind. Specific research and tests with roboticists should be performed in order to find a way of displaying this information that helps anyone understand the whole graph. Once specific key assets are detected they should be implemented one by one  and properly tested with some roboticists to ensure they are widely accepted as a proper enhancement. Several of these features should be developed until the graph becomes easily readable and can be easily managed through the graphical interface provided in robocomp.

Needed skills: Python, Qt5, OSG

Backup Mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez
