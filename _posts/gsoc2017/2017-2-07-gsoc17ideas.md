## General information on applications

If you are interested in any of the ideas listed bellow or you think you can propose something interesting to improve RoboComp we encourage you to apply. It is important to get familiarized with our software, you can go through the available tutorials by now and direct your questions to our mailing list or gitter chat (listed below, also see chat). Please read all the information posted in this page before applying.

Where can I start and what to include on my application?

1. Download robocomp: https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp
2. Get familiarized with the framework: https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/master/doc
3. Try to write down a small example of code on how you would start the development on the idea you choosed
4. Create a schedule with main millestones that you plan to follow during the duration of the program
5. You can send, example, schedule along with your cv and other application materials to the main mentor of your idea, cc the backup mentor

You are encoraged to go through the previous steps for a better understading and follow up of your application.

## 1. Javascript support

NodeJS component code generation. An interesting diversion from current robotics technologies based on C++ and Python would be the use of Javascript as the language to code some highly concurrent components. Most components combine push-pull and RPC communication models to talk to other components in their graph of processes. Additionally, several more threads are normally used to handle the component’s internal workings. In this activity, the code generator will be extended to include Javascript running in a server as a new target language for components. The main restriction here is that ZeroC releases a version of the Ice middleware running on Node, since the web browser version is already out.

Needed skills: Javascript, C++  
Mentor: Pablo Bustos  
Backup mentor: Luis Manso

## 2. Graphic deployment tool

Currently RoboComp has a components management tool that has actually been improved through several years. However for this tool to work a deployment xml file should be provided with the configuration on the components network. Having this network created through a graphical tool would help enormously in the deployment of new setups for different projects. 

Needed skills: Python, C++  
Mentor: Ramon Cintas  
Backup mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez

## 3. Connect RoboComp to Gazebo

RoboComp currently has its own simulation tool RCIS (RoboComp Innermodel Simulator) however it does not incorporate physics simulation. Sometimes robot models are already available under Gazebo, which is a more common simulation environment. Having gazebo as an option for simulations with RoboComp will help grow the possibilities our framework can offer to developers. The idea is to connect RoboComp and Gazebo in a similar way ROS is. This way any simulation with RoboComp can be tested on both simulators (Gazebo or RCIS).

Needed skills: Gazebo, C++, Robotics simulation

## 4. Graphic editor for InnerModel worlds

InnerModel worlds are xml-based files. Most of the time writing down becomes a pain that nobody wants to go through. Even when InnerModel worlds are done, sometimes moving its elements becomes cumbersome. Sometimes it takes several tryouts until whatever you want to move ends up in the right place. Having a graphical tool for creating and editing these files would help enormously.

Needed SKills: C++, OSG or some sort of graphics development knowledge, CMake   
Mentor: Luis Manso  
Backup mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez

## 5. Easing deployment, reduce dependencies, “dockering” robocomp

Docker is a good way to make sure software works independent of the configuration of the system it’s being run. Having demos of RoboComp enclosed into different docker containers can help with deployment in different machines as well as preserve the integrity of a certain demo when it comes the time to run it. 
You will also be responsible of writing down the robocomp-docker documentation and related tutorials.

*First, a refactoring of the CMake structure within RoboComp is needed so basic requirements for installation are reduced to a minimum. On the same page, this activity should ease the task for new developers to add new libraries, classes, tools or modules to the framework.
*To facilitate the deployment on different operating systems, a fully functional Docker container for RoboComp will be developed so instant deployment will be available on heterogeneous platforms through the docker tool.
*A semi-automatic procedure to update changes from the repository to the Docker container will be established.
*To study and analyze virtual infrastructure solutions, such as Open Stack, to provide a virtualized infrastructure that can integrate the physical cluster onboard the robot and external servers for less responsive, but highly computationally demanding, tasks.

Needed skills: Docker, GNU/Linux, C++, CMake  
Mentor: Marco A. Gutiérrez  
Backup mentor: Ramon Cintas

## 6. 3D visualization of internal structures in real time 

Current Model graphs used in RoboComp mainly for cognitive world modeling are not clear to understand, especially when they are big, which they usually are. Making these graphs easier to read and their information easier to access is a key task that will ease the task of debugging and understanding these graphs and in consequence a robot’s mind. Specific research and tests with roboticists should be performed in order to find a way of displaying this information that helps anyone understand the whole graph. Once specific key assets are detected they should be implemented one by one  and properly tested with some roboticists to ensure they are widely accepted as a proper enhancement. Several of these features should be developed until the graph becomes easily readable and can be easily managed through the graphical interface provided in robocomp

Needed skills: Python, Qt5, OSG
