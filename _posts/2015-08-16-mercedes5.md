**Full object manipulation system** : In this post we will describe the full system developed for manipulating objects using a robotic arm. We start at the highest level, VisualIK (the correction system), and we will go down to the base of the system, the IK (which calculates the final angle of the joints of the robotic arm).

###The `visualIK` component

The old [`VisualBIK` component](http://robocomp.github.io/website/2015/06/17/mercedes3.html) has been reorganized, resulting in the current `visualik` component. The basic principle of operation of the component remains, adding some improvements and changing its communication with the `inversekinematics` component, by the `ikGraphGenerator` component.

Its operation revolves around a state machine:

1. `IDLE`: It is the resting state of `visualik`. The component is awaiting receiving a target through one of the methods of its interface.
