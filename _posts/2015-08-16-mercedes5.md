**Full object manipulation system** : In this post we will describe the full system developed for manipulating objects using a robotic arm. We start at the highest level, VisualIK (the correction system), and we will go down to the base of the system, the IK (which calculates the final angle of the joints of the robotic arm).

All the components that will be described below implement the `InverseKinematics` interface. This interface is defined by a series of data structures:

1. Pose6D: It represents a pose with three translations and three rotations [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz]
2. WeightVector: It represents the weight vector of each element of Pose6D. This will help us later in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
3. TargetState: 



###The `visualIK` component

The old [`VisualBIK` component](http://robocomp.github.io/website/2015/06/17/mercedes3.html) has been reorganized, resulting in the current `visualik` component. The basic principle of operation of the component remains, adding some improvements and changing its communication with the `inversekinematics` component, by the `ikGraphGenerator` component.

Its goal remains the same, correct errors produced by the inaccuracies of the joints in the IK. To this end, it bases its operation on a state machine:

1. `IDLE`: It is the resting state of `visualik`. The component is waiting to receive a target through one of the methods of its interface. When a target comes through the interface (stored in the `currentTarget` variable), the state machine switches to INIT_BIK and prepares the global variables for the execution of correction.
2. `INIT_BIK`: in this state, the visualik applies an initial correction to the target (Ec). This correction is based on experience in the correction of previous targets, so the first correction, having no previous experience, will be zero. Then, it sends the target to his proxy of kinematic, the `ikGraphGenerator` component. Finally, the state of the machine is changed to `WAIT_BIK`.
3. `WAIT_BIK`: in this state, the `visualik` waits the end of execution of the target by the `ikGraphGenerator`. When the `ikGraphGenerator` finishes executing the target, the `visualik` changes his state to `CORRECT_ROTATION`.
4. `CORRECT_ROTATION`: It is the latest machine status. In this state is when the `visualik` does all the calculations in order to correct the deviations and errors of the joints. The procedure is simple: a) by apriltags, the `visualik` calculates the visual pose of the end effector; b) then, it computes the error vector between the visual pose and the target pose (Ev); c) with this error vector Ev, the `visualik` corrects the target pose and sends the new position to the `ikGraphGenerator` component; d) this process is repeated until the error achieved in translation and rotation is less than a predetermined threshold; e) finally the `visualik` calculates the error vector between the original target and the last corrected target (Ec), with this error the component realizes the first correction in `INIT_BIK`.

Here there is a scheme of the procedure performed by the `visualik`. It is very summarized to facilitate the understanding of the procedure by the reader:

    1: procedure VISUAL CALIBRATION
    2:    Xt = TargetArrives()
    3:    Ct = Xt + Ec
    4:    sendTargetToGIK(Ct)
    5:    Xv = getAprilTagPose(robot)
    6:    while (Ev = Xv- Xt) > threshold ^Â¬ timeOut() do
    7:         Xi = getInternalPose(robot)
    8:         Xc = Xi + Ev
    9:         sendTargetToGIK(Xc)
    10:        Xv = getAprilTagPose(robot)
    11:   end while
    12:   Ec = Xc - Xt
    13: end procedure
    
Like all components developed by robocomp, the `visualik` needs a configuration file in which the components required (the [`ikGraphGenerator`](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp-ursus/tree/master/components/ikGraphGenerator)) and the components to subscribe (the [`apriltagsComp`](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp-robolab/tree/master/components/apriltagsComp)) and other configuration parameters are determined. In this case, a configuration file may have the following elements:

    CommonBehavior.Endpoints=tcp -p 14537
    # Endpoints for implemented interfaces
    InverseKinematics.Endpoints=tcp -p 10242


AprilTagsTopic.Endpoints=tcp -p 12938

# Proxies for required interfaces
